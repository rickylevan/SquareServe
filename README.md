# SquareServe
A toy protocol implementation on a TCP socket

This code is for fun. I hope it can also be a useful reference
for someone about what sockets and protocols actually mean (as opposed
to reading hand-wavey descriptions online), with a block of code that
can easily be read in one sitting. What's more, this protocol defines
a server that actually does something useful! In the event that the 
client host cannot do multiplication, this server could find its day
in the sun. :)

I also include tests that demonstrate conformance with the spec. To
run them, simply enter "go test" after cloning and `cd`ing into the
repository.
